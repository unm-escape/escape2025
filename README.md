## About
ESCAPE 2025 is a week-long program designed to introduce participants to scientific computing, Earth science and spatial data analysis in a fun, inclusive, collaborative environment.

The materials for ESCAPE were developed through support from the National Science Foundation (NSF grants [EAR-2146272](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2146272), [RISE-2325476](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2325476), [OCE-2314273](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2314273)). This year's program is made possible through generous support from the UNM Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences.

This repository contains the course schedule and python notebooks for activities throughout the week. Additional course materials, shared files, and lecture slides will also be available on Google Drive.
